Project:	CS3990, Assignment 02
		HTML&CSS, Tree Branches Unlimited

Date Issued:	20-Jan-2016

File:		README.txt

Repository:	https://github.com/kaethis/CS3990_Assign02

Notes:		- While I'm still unsatisfied with the look-and-
		  feel of the site, I really ought not let
		  aesthetic choices delay this submission any
		  longer.  I really need to keep this in mind.

		- I implemented a table by using one to display
		  the different branches on the product page.
		  While one might argue this could be considered
		  "tabular data", I admit it's still dangerously
		  close to a layout table.  I'll probably redo it
		  in the next assignment.

		- Includes an order page with an incomplete form.
                  This is not reflective of Assignment 03; that
		  will follow shortly.
